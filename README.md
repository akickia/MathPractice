# MathPractice
Making my first webapp - practice simple math

A first attempt of creating something bigger with JavaScript. 

The user can choose witch calculating method they want to practice and then start the challenge. 
The user gets random numbers to calculate in a certain amount of time and get a point for each right answer. 
When the time is up, the user see their score and can try again.

I will also add an alternative for wanting to skip the number and get a new one instead.
